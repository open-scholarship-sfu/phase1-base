# Who am I? What is this Open Scholarship Initiative?

::: {.notes}
- I'm the open science community manager for the open scholarship framework initiative
- The framework will represent SFU’s commitment to OS and define the pathways towards SFU becoming an “Open Scholarship University.”
- These principles are intended as guidelines to practicing OS at SFU, rather than policy.

::: {.notes}
- Nothing we do within a university is disconnected from the world outside of it. There are social, political and environmental contexts to everything we do.
- We believe in an academic environment that is aware of its surroundings, and is open to dialogue with the different aspects of our society.

***As open as possible, as closed as necessary.***
:::

::: {.notes}
Open scholarship is part of a responsible science practice, and it can be part of unresponsible academic conduct too.
We don't believe in automatic openness - instead, we trust our community to make educated decisions about how much should be disclosed, and when.
Some things shouldn’t be automatically shared, e.g. conservation data, medical records, indigenous data

Publish a preprint when submitting your paper for review!

*If you can't pay for an APC, publishing a preprint is a great way to make your findings accessible!*
:::

::: {.notes}
- Preprints give credit and stabilishes priority to you and your team, while giving visibility to your findings.
- Most journals accept concurrent publication of a manuscript on a preprint server before or at the same time it is submitted to review.
- The public comments on your preprint can help you improve your manuscript before publication.
- Try publishing a preprint and promote a review party in your department!
