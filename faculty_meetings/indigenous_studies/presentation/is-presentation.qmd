# What is the Open Scholarship Initiative? {.slide-title-bg}

::: notes
-   The framework will represent SFU’s commitment to OS and define the pathways towards SFU becoming an “Open Scholarship University.”
-   These principles are guidelines by which we want to practice scholarship as a community.

## SFU Open Science and Open Scholarship Principles

* [**People**]{style="color:darkred"} front and center  

* Respect and acknowledge [**nuance**]{style="color:darkred"}  

* [**Connect**]{style="color:darkred"} and [**decentralize**]{style="color:darkred"}  

* Institutional [**support**]{style="color:darkred"}

::: notes
-   Nothing we do within a university is disconnected from the world outside of it. There are social, political and environmental contexts to everything we do.
-   We believe in an academic environment that is aware of its surroundings, and is open to dialogue with the different aspects of our society.

## The open movement in scholarship practices

*Responsible researchers...*

* Strive for excellence and *take responsibility*. 

* *Respect* the law, research ethics, and professional standards.  

* *Support* a culture of *transparency*, *openness*, and honesty towards other researchers and the *public*.  

* *Maximise public benefit* and avoid resource waste.

***As open as possible, as closed as necessary.***
:::


::: notes
Open scholarship is part of a responsible research practice, and it can be part of unresponsible academic conduct too. We don't believe in automatic openness - instead, we trust our community to make educated decisions about how much should be disclosed, and when. Some things shouldn’t be automatically shared, e.g. conservation data, medical records, indigenous data

## Open scholarship and funding agencies

* Canadian federal funding agencies are [**decreasing**]{style="color:darkred"} their focus on pay-for-publishing OA publications and datasets.^[[Draft, Revised Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications, 2025↗︎](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/open-access/draft-revised-tri-agency-open-access-policy-publications)]

* FAIR data can [**save up to 9%**]{style="color:darkred"} of a project’s costs ^[[Europe, SPARC. 2019. “Using Open and FAIR Data to Increase Research Efficiency.”↗︎](https://sparceurope.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2019/04/SPARC-Europe_Brief_ODEfficiency.pdf){target="_blank"}]

* “The annual [**cost**]{style="color:darkred"} of not making data FAIR in Europe is a minimum of [**€10.2bn per year**]{style="color:darkred"}.” ^2^

::: notes
Preprints and independent deposits are being respected.
More flexibility to demonstrate open practices.
