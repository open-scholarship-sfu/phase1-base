# Who am I? What is the Open Scholarship Initiative? {.slide-title-bg}

::: notes
-   I'm the open science community manager for the open scholarship framework initiative
-   The framework will represent SFU’s commitment to OS and define the pathways towards SFU becoming an “Open Scholarship University.”
-   These principles are guidelines by which we want to practice scholarship as a community.

::: notes
-   Nothing we do within a university is disconnected from the world outside of it. There are social, political and environmental contexts to everything we do.
-   We believe in an academic environment that is aware of its surroundings, and is open to dialogue with the different aspects of our society.

## The open movement

::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
1.  Share decision making

2.  Share content

## The open movement in scholarship practices

*Responsible researchers...*


-   Strive for excellence and *take responsibility*\
-   *Respect* the law, research ethics, and professional standards\
-   *Support* a culture of *transparency*, *openness*, and honesty towards other researchers and the *public*\
-   *Maximise public benefit* and avoid resource waste

***As open as possible, as closed as necessary.***
:::

::: notes
Open scholarship is part of a responsible research practice, and it can be part of unresponsible academic conduct too. We don't believe in automatic openness - instead, we trust our community to make educated decisions about how much should be disclosed, and when. Some things shouldn’t be automatically shared, e.g. conservation data, medical records, indigenous data

## Open scholarship and funding agencies

::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
Canadian federal funding agencies are [**decreasing**]{style="color:darkred"} their focus on Gold OA for publication and datasets.
:::

::: notes
Preprints and independent deposits are being respected.
More flexibility to demonstrate open practices.

The Open Scholarship Framework aims to **connect** and **decentralize** open scholarship initiatives accross Faculties, while nurturing a community of practice that leads SFU in becoming an **open university**.

<!---Questions for Faculty members
* Are there any reports on publication practices in this Faculty? We'd love to know where your community is publishing and how.

* What are the main barriers that you perceive in adopting open scholarship practices?

* What support looks like for you in the process of becoming a more open Faculty?
