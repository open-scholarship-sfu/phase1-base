# 2nd Canadian Open Science and Open Scholarship Meeting

## SFU proposals

### Overall vision and approach for the event and how they might align with or build upon the inaugural edition

We left the 1st Canadian Conference on Open Science and Open Scholarship felt energized and inspired by the connections created during the two days of program. We felt that many conversations showed a maturity level that is compatible with Canada's leadership in the open scholarship movement, which is in part, maybe to the fact that we were surrounded by people we knew.

One of the highlights of the program that we wish to replicate is the career range of the speakers in the panels. It was impressive to see important leaders in the movement, like Leslie Chan and Monica Granados, discussing Open Scholarship on the same stage as undergraduate and PhD students.

In terms of guest speakers, we would like to bring back such leaders (Leslie Chan has already demonstrated interest in coming to SFU to talk about open science), as well as other global leaders in the movement to add an international and interdisciplinary context layers to the discussions (potential names are Daniela Saderi, Ignasi Bartomeus, Malvika Sharan, Prachee Avasthi, Andre Chagas, and Abigail Mayes). Beyond that, we think it is absolutely necessary to open space for discussions about funding, regulation and metrics. We want to bring politicians, representants of private and public funding agencies, and university leaders to the same table to discuss these themes. 

We also appreciated the space to discuss practical solutions to tangible problems during the working group sessions. However, we feel like the session would be more effective if there was guidance before the Conference with previous distribution of discussion points, and preparation of the facilitators to guide the conversation during the event. If we are to keep this section of the program, we would implement these changes.

Another highlight of the event was the flexibility in the booths and poster sessions. We will consider bringing this back in an expanded way, in the format of the technology festivals where participants host problem-solving sessions or art and technology installations. We believe that this is a more cost-effective format, and it doesn't require the production of new, disposable materials such as conference posters.

In terms of collaboration and openness of the organization process, we will implement a federated event design format which will involve a diverse range of members in our community, especially our committee members listed below, in the programming and decision-making process of the event.

Finally, we commit to not bring back speakers who have caused harm in their talks during the past edition, and to prioritize EDIA principles when composing the programming of the event.


### Team composition
The Open Scholarship Framework initiative is a coallition of Open Scholarship champions at the Simon Fraser University. We are a team of staff, faculty and students who practice and advocate for open scholarship principles at SFU, with the goal of making it the default way of producing knowledge within our community.

Some of the people involved in our initiative are:

* Kelly Shen: Kelly is the Open Scholaship Framework initiative lead manager and the Director of Operations at the Insitute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology. 

* Gracielle Higino: she's the open science community manager, with extensive background in open science practices and leadership. 

* We have a committee that we expect to involve in the programming part of the conference, suggesting and connecting us with potential guest speakers, helping in the selection of abstract submissions, and guiding the overarching story of the Conference. The members of this committee are:
    * Aniko Takacs-Cox - Director - Research Services
    * Keshav Mukunda - Research Data Librarian - Library
    * Kristie Westerlaken - Director - Research Ethics & Security
    * Mark Pickup - Associate Professor - Chair Research Ethics Board & faculty at FASS
    * Megan Meredith-Lobay - Associate Director - Research Computing Group
    * Nilay Yalçin - Assistant Professor - School of Interactive Arts and Technology
    * Trevor Davis - Executive Director - Research Operations
    * Urooj Nizami - Librarian - Public Knowledge Project
    * Will Hsiao - Associate Professor - Faculty of Health Sciences

* Ali Moore: is the Digital Scholarship Librarian of the Research Commons department at the SFU Library
* Nicole White: is the Head of the Research Commons department at the SFU Library

We'd also like to highlight a few points about how SFU and our initiative is strategically positioned to host the next CCOSOS:

* SFU is the host institution of one of the most important open scholarship infrastructure facilities in the world: the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca/). The PKP is not only a globally recognized initiative that supports thousands of open access journals, but it's also a metascience research hub which informs and sets the agenda about open access scholarly publishing internationally.

* SFU is also host of [one of the powerful research computing facilities in Canada](https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2025/09/canada-s-fastest-academic-supercomputer-is-now-online-at-sfu-aft.html), having received millions of dollars in the past few years to invest in reproducible research infrastructure.

* SFU is also leading the Open Scholarship movement in Canada, being [the first in the country to become an open university](https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2025/03/sfu-first-in-canada-to-adopt-university-wide-open-scholarship-fr/), and having an [open access policy](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/publish/scholarly-publishing/open-access/open-access-policy) active since 2017.

* Other examples of leadership in open scholarship and open technology practices at SFU are CrimXiv, Amplify Podcast Network, Knowledge Link, Knowledge Mobilization, the Open Source Dev students club, the School of Interactive Arts and Technology (which hosts R&D in open source software and hardware), and the Institute of Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (which trains its students in open science practices by default).
