# Code of Conduct

### Open Scholarship Framework Initiative

Open Scholarship Framework Initiative at the Simon Fraser University is, by
essence, a community project. We advocate for a culture change by connecting
people and projects within the SFU community in the practice of open scholarship
principles. As the main purpose of this community, we provide support in
infrastructure and capacity building to empower SFU students and employees to
practice open science and open scholarship. 
 
We do that in the form of human resources, funding, capacity building and
community engagement. Our community members meet and interact in person at the
Vancouver, Burnaby and Surrey *campi*, and online. They also help to organise
events and speak at them, and support each other on grant writing and policy
proposals drafting, and are encouraged to take an active role in the strategic
direction of the Framework.
 
The Open Scholarship Framework is funded by the Tanenbaum Open Science Institute
and the Simon Fraser University, and therefore our community also complies with
the community guidelines specified by both institutions.

## Our pledge

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to support a community where all people
should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, and
applies to all participants of the Open Scholarship Framework Initiative - Simon
Fraser University. This Code aims to promote a respectful, inclusive, and safe
environment that supports the mission of the Initiative, within or beyond the
limits of the SFU *campi*.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct must be respected in all events, gatherings, meetings, or
workshops, online or in-person, that are hosted by the Open Scholarship
Initiative. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.


## Expected behaviours 

In our community, we strive to:

1. **Be respectful**: All members of the OSFI community are expected to treat
   each other with respect and dignity, regardless of differences in background,
   beliefs, or opinions. We aknowledge that discussions around Open Science and
   Open Scholarship can be controversial and intertwines closely with each
   person's perspectives about the role of the scientific endeavour, and this
   can lead to disagreements. We strongly believe that our community members do
   not let these disagreements turn into personal attacks and poor behaviour.

3. **Be welcoming and inclusive**: Our members are committed to fostering an
   inclusive environment where diversity is valued and all individuals feel
   welcome and supported, regardless of age, race, ethnicity, culture, national
   origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational
   level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size,
   family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

4. **Safety**: The safety and well-being of all members of the OSFI community is
   a priority. Harassment, discrimination, and violence will not be tolerated.
   This includes, but is not limited to: threats or language directed against
   another person, discriminatory and language, sharing sexually explicit or
   violent material, sharing (or threatening to share) other people’s personally
   identifying information, insults, unwelcome sexual attention.

5. **Accountability**: Members of the OSFI community are responsible for their
   actions and must adhere to this Code of Conduct. We also commit to protect
   each other and to report harm whenever ir occurs.



## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their
best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation,
and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help
avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a
possible violation, please contact the Open Scholarship Framework team at
open_sci@sfu.ca.

The Community Management take reports of violations seriously and will make
every effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports of
code of conduct violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or
interviewing witnesses and other participants. The Community Management will keep
investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while
prioritizing safety and confidentiality. In order to honor these values,
enforcement actions are carried out in private with the involved parties, but
communicating to the whole community may be part of a mutually agreed upon
resolution. 

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If an investigation by the Community Manager finds that this Code of Conduct
has been violated, the following enforcement ladder may be used to determine how
best to repair harm, based on the incident's impact on the individuals involved
and the community as a whole. Depending on the severity of a violation, lower
rungs on the ladder may be skipped.

1. Warning a) Event: A violation involving inappropriate language or other
behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. b) Consequence: A
private, written warning from the Community Manager. c) Repair: Examples of
repair include a private written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and
seeking clarification on expectations.

2. Temporary Suspension a) Event: A repeated incidence of a violation that
previously resulted in a warning, or the first incidence of a more serious
violation. b) Consequence: A private written warning with conditions for return
from suspension. c) Repair: Examples of repair may include making an apology,
using the cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful
about re-entering community spaces after the period is over.

3. Permanent Ban a) Event: A pattern of repeated code of conduct violations that
other steps on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that
the Community Manager determines there is no way to keep the community safe with
this person as a member. b) Consequence: Access to all community spaces, tools,
and communication channels is removed. In general, permanent bans should be
rarely used, should have strong reasoning behind them, and should only be
resorted to if working through other remedies has failed to change the behavior.
c) Repair: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity.

This enforcement ladder is intended as a guideline. It does not limit the
ability of Community Managers to use their discretion and judgment, in keeping
with the best interests of our community.
