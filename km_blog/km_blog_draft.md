As we learn how to be academics, researchers and scholars, we find out very
early on that the production of knowledge encompasses much more than asking
great questions and answering them. At some point we have the impression that
the questions are only a tiny part of the whole process, and the large majority
of time is spent in methods and protocols to ensure that our answers are
ethical, correct, verifiable, and somehow accessible to at least a handful of
other people. Producing new knowledge is very expensive, and most of us have
limited access to resources to support this production. In fact, it is not
uncommon to see governments cutting down the budget lines dedicated to research
and education, affecting not only researchers, but the whole chain of knowledge
production and transfer, and even public policies in other countries.  

One thing that could mitigate this problem is to share these resources and the
results of the research cycles. This way, we wouldn't need to invest more to
re-do something that was already done, and we could more easily build on top of
other people's knowledge to create an interconnected and global network of human
knowledge. Just like knowledge mobilization, this resource-sharing strategy also 
enhances inclusion by promoting knowledge exchanges between equity-seeking, 
underrepresented or excluded groups, and by "reducing inequalities in access to 
scientific development, infrastructures and capabilities among different countries 
and regions" ([UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, 2021](https://doi.org/10.54677/MNMH8546)). 

The Open Scholarship practices help scholars to reduce the waste of their
research endeavours. It includes concepts such as open access, open education,
and open data, each of them characterizing a specific aspect of sharing
knowledge, but also flourishing as interdependent concepts, sometimes. Whenever
you come across the term "open", it means that someone has thought about how
other people could (or could not) re-use that product. People often think that
"open" means "free", but that's not always true. For example, you might need to
buy open source hardware, but the fact that it is "open" means that if you find
a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, you can make a contribution directly
to the project. Or you can start your own prototype of your own hardware based
on the one you've bought! 

Another example is "open data". When someone collect data for a specific
research project, they start a lifecycle that can either end with a publication
of a paper, or get a "stretch" when deposited with a license on a data
repository. Publicly depositing data allows other researchers to skip the
process of collecting that data all over again, wasting resources and slowing
down the production of new knowledge. It also makes that research trustworthy,
as anyone can reproduce the analyses and check if the results are true. However,
data sharing is a practice that does not overwrite the right to privacy, and
very often human data cannot be shared publicly. There are ways to account for
that and still be part of the "open scholarship" movement, as long as the
researchers are transparent about why the data can't be shared and what did they
do with it. 

The open movement tries to empower people to overcome the limitations of
resource sharing in knowledge production and usage. With that vision in mind,
the Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology of the Simon Fraser
University is leading a revolution to make it possible for every member of the
SFU community to implement open practices to their academic routines. Our role
will be to connect all the open scholarship initiatives already in place at SFU
(such as the open access and open data hubs at the library, the public knowledge
project at publishing, and the open educational resources office), grassroots 
movements and the knowledge mobilization hub to promote community-led events and 
programs to support students, faculty and staff to design their scholarly products
under the "open lens".   

There will be many opportunities to contribute and collaborate to this movement!
We will need community leaders to help us organize events and workshops, people
to help us spread the word and to mentor other community members. If you want to
keep an eye on what we're doing, sign up to our newsletter here <link>.

Just like the KM Hub, we want to do more with what we know 
"by intentionally co-creating, disseminating, and implementing research". If our 
dreams are to come true, in 10 years the whole SFU community will think
of open scholarship as the way that they know how to do things. It will not be a
matter of resources or infrastructure â€“ we will all be working together to share
what we have the privilege to produce for the benefit of all.
