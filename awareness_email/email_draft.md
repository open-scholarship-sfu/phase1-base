## Draft email to be sent to departments/chairs

Dear {director/chair name},

The Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (INN) is leading the
implementation of [SFU’s Open Science and Open Scholarship
Principles](https://www.sfu.ca/research/performance-excellence/open-science/open-science-principles.html)
by working with experts and growing the open scholarship community at SFU.

We are envisioning a culture change at SFU where the impacts of scholarly
pursuits on society are maximized through the sharing of resources, intellectual
property, as well as of the research process itself across disciplines. We
believe that this change can create more equitable access to scholarship,
accelerate discovery and innovation, increase the efficiency and quality of
scholarship, and promote transparency and accountability. 

We would love to grow our open scholarship community with your department/school
by being included in conversations with faculty, staff and students.
Specifically, I  would like to join you in {seminar series X / Faculty Meeting}
this Fall term, to talk about how we envision this culture change at SFU and to
hear from your members about their impressions.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards, 
Randy McIntosh
