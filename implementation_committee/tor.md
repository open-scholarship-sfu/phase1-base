## Implementation committee - Open Scholarship Framework at SFU

1. Introduction  
The Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (INN) is leading the implementation of SFU’s Open Science and Open Scholarship Principles by working with experts and growing the open scholarship community at SFU. In partnership with the Tanenbaum Open Science Institute, the implementation committee will work together with the Open Scholarship Framework leaders to advise on and carry out an implementation plan to support SFU faculty, staff and students in integrating open scholarship practices into their projects from start to finish.

1. Committee membership  
The committee will consist initially of three members from different faculties of SFU, with the goal of being composed by ten members (one member from each Faculty of SFU) by January 2026. Members will span the whole range of roles in the SFU community (students, faculty and staff), with expertise in various aspects of research, including but not limited to open access, intellectual property, data governance, and collaboration. The members are appointed based on their knowledge and experience in these areas, but most importantly, on their community leadership skills.

1. Committee Objectives  
The goal of the implementation committee is to advise on and carry on the implementation of the open scholarship principles at their faculty level. They will leverage their knowledge about their own communities and disciplines to tailor the principles and support to their community's needs. Committee members will lead, with the support of the Open Science Community Manager, the organization of events, workshops and any other support activity needed.

1. Membership Commitment  
Committee members will participate in an onboarding program starting in September 2025 that will inform them on the open scholarship landscape at SFU and globally, and support the design of a community project of their own. The program will span XX weeks, with 1h online meetings every other week, and coaching meetings of 30 min in alternate weeks. After the onboarding program is finished, the members will then implement their projects in their own communities with the support of the Open Science Community Manager.  
One of the primary tasks of the committee member will be to recruit a small team to help them run their community project.

1. Reporting  
The committee and the Open Sciece Community Manager will meet once a month as a group and individually as needed to ensure that the community projects are running smoothly. The frequency of the meetings will be revised as a group on the second meeting.
