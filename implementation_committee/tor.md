## Implementation committee - Open Scholarship Framework at SFU

1.  Introduction\
    The Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (INN) is leading
    the implementation of SFU’s Open Science and Open Scholarship
    Principles by working with experts and growing the open scholarship
    community at SFU. In partnership with the Tanenbaum Open Science
    Institute, the implementation committee will work together with the
    Open Scholarship Framework leaders to advise on and carry out an
    implementation plan to support SFU faculty, staff and students in
    integrating open scholarship practices into their projects from
    start to finish.

2.  Committee membership\
    The committee will consist initially of six members from across SFU,
    with the goal of expanding to 16 members by January 2026. These 16
    members include two Open Scholarship Framework team members, one
    member from each of the 10 Faculties, and members from relevant
    stakeholder groups including but not limited to Library, Research
    Ethics Board, IT, and the Office of the Vice-President, Research and
    Innovation. Members will span the whole range of roles in the SFU
    community (students, faculty and staff), with expertise in various
    aspects of research, including but not limited to open access,
    intellectual property, data governance, and collaboration. The
    members are appointed based on their knowledge and experience in
    these areas, but most importantly, on their community leadership
    skills.

3.  Committee Objectives\
    The goal of the implementation committee is to advise on and carry out the
    implementation of the Open Scholarship Principles in their relevant areas.
    They will leverage their knowledge about their own communities and
    disciplines to tailor the Open Scholarship principles and advise on
    strategies to support their community's needs. Committee members
    contributions will include:

    -   To advise about the changes in the infrastructure needed to allow the
        open scholarship culture to emerge, including fundraising, community
        strategies and policy making.

    -   To advise on budget allocation.

    -   To co-design the implementation goals and roadmap based on their
        Faculty's needs and opportunities.

    -   To help articulating sub-committees of culture change (composed of
        students, faculty and staff), which will promote events,
        workshops, community projects in general, and dialogues for
        policy changes within their Faculty.

    -   To establish continuous engagement with external partners, other
        institutions, funding agencies, and stakeholders.

    -   To advocate for and be an early adopter of the Open Scholarship
        principles.


4.  Membership Commitment\
    Members are expected to have a commitment of one to three
    years, starting on September 2025. An initial onboarding process
    will inform them on the open scholarship landscape at SFU and
    globally, and set the initial goals for the whole committee. Group
    meetings will be held online once per term with the duration of 90
    minutes, with eventual asynchronous work and communication between them.
    Individual meetings with the Open Scholarship representatives will
    also be scheduled as needed.

5.  Reporting\
    Community leaders will report to the Open Scholarship Framework
    representatives about the progress towards the goals set by the
    implementation committee members. The Open Scholarship Framework
    representatives will report to the implementation committee during the
    online meetings, updating members about community engagement, policy
    implementations and goal settings. Committee members will then re-evaluate
    the goals with the OS representatives, and a summary of each meeting will
    then be reported to the Open Scholarship Framework initiative leaders.
