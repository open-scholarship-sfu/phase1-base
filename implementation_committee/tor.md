## Implementation Committee - Open Scholarship Framework at SFU

1.  Introduction\
    The Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (INN) is leading
    the implementation of SFUâ€™s Open Science and Open Scholarship
    Principles by working with experts and growing the open scholarship
    community at SFU. The Implementation Committee will work together with the
    Open Scholarship Framework leaders to advise on and carry out an
    implementation plan to support SFU faculty, staff and students in
    integrating open scholarship practices into their projects from
    start to finish.

2.  Committee Membership\
    The Committee will consist initially of six members from across SFU,
    with the goal of expanding to 16 members by January 2026. The Committee will be chaired by the lead of the Open Scholarship Framework and will also include the Open Science Community Manager. The remaining 14 members will strive to include one
    member from each Faculty, and members from relevant
    stakeholder groups including, but not limited to, Library, Research
    Ethics Board, IT, and the Office of the Vice-President, Research and
    Innovation. Members will span the whole range of roles in the SFU
    community (students, faculty and staff), with expertise in various
    aspects of research including, but not limited to, open access,
    intellectual property, data governance, and collaboration. The
    members are appointed based on their knowledge and experience in
    these areas but, most importantly, on their community leadership
    skills.

3.  Committee Objectives\
    The goal of the Implementation Committee is to advise on and carry out the
    implementation of the Open Scholarship Principles in their relevant areas.
    They will leverage their knowledge about their own communities and
    disciplines to tailor the implementation of the Open Scholarship principles and advise on
    strategies to support their community's needs. Committee members
    contributions will be to:

    -   advocate for and be an early adopter of the Open Scholarship
        principles;

    -   co-design the implementation goals and roadmap based on their
        area's needs and opportunities;

    -   advise on infrastructure changes needed to allow an
        open scholarship culture to emerge, including fundraising, community
        strategies and policy making;

    -   help articulate sub-committees of culture change (composed of
        students, faculty and staff), which will promote events,
        workshops, community projects in general, and dialogues for
        policy changes within their areas;

    -   establish continuous engagement with external partners, other
        institutions, funding agencies, and stakeholders; and

    -   advise on budget allocation.

4.  Membership Commitment\
    Members are expected to serve on the committee between one to three years. An initial onboarding process
    will inform them on the open scholarship landscape at SFU and
    globally, and set the initial goals for the whole committee. Group
    meetings will be held online once per term with a duration of 90
    minutes, with asynchronous work and communication between meetings as needed.
    Individual meetings with the Open Scholarship initiative representatives will
    also be scheduled as needed.

5.  Reporting\
    Summary reports of each meeting will be created by the Committee chair and Open Science Community Manager and shared with the INN executive. Summary reports of initiative activities will also be shared with the INN executive at the end of each academic term.
