## Implementation committee - Open Scholarship Framework at SFU

1. Introduction  
The Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (INN) is leading the implementation of SFU’s Open Science and Open Scholarship Principles by working with experts and growing the open scholarship community at SFU. In partnership with the Tanenbaum Open Science Institute, the implementation committee will work together with the Open Scholarship Framework leaders to advise on and carry out an implementation plan to support SFU faculty, staff and students in integrating open scholarship practices into their projects from start to finish.

1. Committee membership  
The committee will consist initially of six members from across SFU, with the goal of expanding to 16 members by January 2026. These 16 members include two Open Scholarship Framework team members, one member from each of the 10 Faculties, and members from relevant stakeholder groups including but not limited to Library, Research Ethics Board, IT, and the Office of the Vice-President, Research and Innovation. Members will span the whole range of roles in the SFU community (students, faculty and staff), with expertise in various aspects of research, including but not limited to open access, intellectual property, data governance, and collaboration. The members are appointed based on their knowledge and experience in these areas, but most importantly, on their community leadership skills.

1. Committee Objectives  
The goal of the implementation committee is to advise on and carry out the implementation of the Open Scholarship Principles in their relevant areas. They will leverage their knowledge about their own communities and disciplines to tailor the principles and support to their community's needs. Committee members will lead, with the support of the Open Science Community Manager, the organization of events, workshops and any other support activity needed.
<!---> This description of what committee members should prioritize strategic activities like goal-setting, seeking grant funding, changing policies, evaluation processes, etc. Certainly, they can help the initial launch of events but I see these as activities that are then delegated to sub committees of champions and we use the implementation committee to continume doing more high level strategy and steering of the initiative. Can you review the draft implementation plan and make sure all the other kinds of activities in the draft are reflected in the TOR? <---> 

1. Membership Commitment  
Committee members will participate in an onboarding program starting in September 2025 that will inform them on the open scholarship landscape at SFU and globally, and support the design of a community project of their own. The program will span XX weeks, with 1h online meetings every other week, and coaching meetings of 30 min in alternate weeks. After the onboarding program is finished, the members will then implement their projects in their own communities with the support of the Open Science Community Manager.  
One of the primary tasks of the committee member will be to recruit a small team to help them run their community project.
<!---> Again, I think this needs to be changed to reflect a more strategic direction for the implementation committee. I see fewer meetings where their roles are to help create project subcommittees rather than they lead the projects themselves. Maybe two per term and asynchronous work/communications as needed? <---> 

1. Reporting  
The committee and the Open Sciece Community Manager will meet once a month as a group and individually as needed to ensure that the community projects are running smoothly. The frequency of the meetings will be revised as a group on the second meeting.
<!---> I think this should be revised to how the Committee reports to the initiative leaders (e.g., INN exec, OVPRI) - probably quarterly via email updates from open scholarship reps on the committee (i.e., us), with ad hoc meetings as needed. <--->
