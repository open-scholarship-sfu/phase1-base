## Implementation committee - Open Scholarship Framework at SFU

1.  Introduction\
    The Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (INN) is leading
    the implementation of SFU’s Open Science and Open Scholarship
    Principles by working with experts and growing the open scholarship
    community at SFU. In partnership with the Tanenbaum Open Science
    Institute, the implementation committee will work together with the
    Open Scholarship Framework leaders to advise on and carry out an
    implementation plan to support SFU faculty, staff and students in
    integrating open scholarship practices into their projects from
    start to finish.

2.  Committee membership\
    The committee will consist initially of six members from across SFU,
    with the goal of expanding to 16 members by January 2026. These 16
    members include two Open Scholarship Framework team members, one
    member from each of the 10 Faculties, and members from relevant
    stakeholder groups including but not limited to Library, Research
    Ethics Board, IT, and the Office of the Vice-President, Research and
    Innovation. Members will span the whole range of roles in the SFU
    community (students, faculty and staff), with expertise in various
    aspects of research, including but not limited to open access,
    intellectual property, data governance, and collaboration. The
    members are appointed based on their knowledge and experience in
    these areas, but most importantly, on their community leadership
    skills.

3.  Committee Objectives\
    The goal of the implementation committee is to advise on and carry
    out the implementation of the Open Scholarship Principles in their
    relevant areas. They will leverage their knowledge about their own
    communities and disciplines to tailor the principles and support to
    their community's needs. Committee members contributions will
    include:

    -   To lead, with the support of the Open Science Community Manager,
        the changes in the infrastructure to allow the open scholarship
        culture to emerge, including fundraising, community strategies
        and policy making.

    -   To co-design the implementation goals and roadmap based on their
        Faculty's needs and opportunities.

    -   Planning of infrastructure enhancements and new developments.

    -   To develop the process for evaluating uptake of open scholarship
        practices at SFU.

    -   To articulate sub-committees of culture change (composed of
        students, faculty and staff), which will promote events,
        workshops, community projects in general, and dialogues for
        policy changes within their Faculty.

    -   To establish continuous engagement with external partners, other
        institutions, funding agencies, and stakeholders.

    -   To establish long-term model for financial sustainability of
        open science and open scholarship support.

        <!---> This description of what committee members should prioritize strategic activities like goal-setting, seeking grant funding, changing policies, evaluation processes, etc. Certainly, they can help the initial launch of events but I see these as activities that are then delegated to sub committees of champions and we use the implementation committee to continume doing more high level strategy and steering of the initiative. Can you review the draft implementation plan and make sure all the other kinds of activities in the draft are reflected in the TOR? <--->

4.  Membership Commitment\
    Members will are expected to have a commitment of one to three
    years, starting on September 2025. An initial onboarding process
    will inform them on the open scholarship landscape at SFU and
    globally, and set the initial goals for the whole committee. Group
    meetings will be held online twice per term with the duration of 90
    minutes, with asynchronous work and communication between them.
    Individual meetings with the Open Scholarship representatives will
    also be scheduled as needed.

    <!--->@graciellehigino I changed the champions program idea to a simple "working group/Scrum" strategy here. We can work together with the committee to design the Champions program and test that with the sub-committees next year.<--->

5.  Reporting\
    The committee will report to the Open Scholarship Framework
    representatives every three months through a short webform, which
    will then be discussed with the Open Scholarship Framework
    initiative leaders.

    <!---> I think this should be revised to how the Committee reports to the initiative leaders (e.g., INN exec, OVPRI) - probably quarterly via email updates from open scholarship reps on the committee (i.e., us), with ad hoc meetings as needed. @graciellehigino I thought a simple report using a webform would bring lower friction to the reporting task because we'll already have the meetings to catch-up and reporting. However, I'd like to know what we need to report to TOSI in terms of data, so we can design this part accordingly and make sure we get all the data we need for the final report three years from now.<--->
